# Benchmarking Brain-Computer Interface Algorithms using MOABB: Riemannian Methods vs. Convolutional Neural Networks 
This work uses an adapted fork of MOABB v0.4.6 and makes use of the EEGNet implementation from https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels

## Abstract
To date, a comprehensive comparison of Riemannian decoding methods with deep convolutional neural networks for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces remains absent from published work. We address this research gap by using MOABB, The Mother Of All BCI Benchmarks, to compare EEGNet, a convolutional neural network, to state-of-the-art Riemannian approaches across a broad range of EEG data sets, including motor imagery, P300, and steady-state visual evoked potentials paradigms. While we do not find statistically significant differences for within-subject decoding, EEGNet performed significantly better than the Riemannian approaches in the SSVEP cross-subject transfer learning setting.
